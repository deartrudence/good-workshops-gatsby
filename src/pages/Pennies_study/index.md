<h3 class="secondary-title case-study">The Brief</h3>
<p>Pennies was undergoing a full rebrand / re-design and needed a website to match their new direction and aesthetic. The goal was to create a site that put pertinent restaurant info (the menu, the hours of operation) at the forefront while also carrying through a sense of fun and play. The new website would include an e-commerce component, integrating the Pennies branding into merchandise that could be purchased online. </p>



<h3 class="secondary-title case-study">The Solution</h3>
<p>The Pennies website needed to be flexible, easy to edit and manage, and seamlessly integrate e-commerce. To respond to all of these needs we elected to build a custom Shopify theme with a Printful app integration.</p>
<p>The theme leverages Shopify’s Section tool so all of the images and text can be edited by Pennies.</p>
<p>The Printful integration let’s Pennies take their branding assets and easily turn them into hats, t-shirts, and shot glasses.</p>

<h3 class="secondary-title case-study">The Final Product</h3>

<section class="process">
<h3>The Site</h3>
<p>The pennies site has a lot of playful animations and colourful imagery. The menu is prominently featured and new deals can be highlighted in the scrolling ticker.</p>
