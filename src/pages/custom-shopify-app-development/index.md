 <h3 class="secondary-title case-study">The Brief</h3>
<p>Create a platform where the CanadaFBM2020 team can easily communicate with the Canadian and German publishing communities. Allow publishers to submit titles with available German publishing rights on the platform. Allow German publishers to easily peruse titles and select some for publishing.</p>



 <h3 class="secondary-title case-study">The Solution</h3>
<p>Leverage the content management system of Shopify to make adding, sorting, and filtering titles seamless. Build a custom web application to extend the functionality of the e-commerce site and allow publishers to submit their own titles for approval and generate and download PDFs of select titles.</p>

<h3>Wireframes</h3>
<p>In this phase low fidelity mock-ups are created to show a visual representation of what content will show up where on the user facing portions of the site. This helps the client start to imagine how a user can interact with information. It also provides a great tool to see any holes in content. Identifying the content structure and layout at this phase helps to maximize the utility of time spent moving forward.</p>
