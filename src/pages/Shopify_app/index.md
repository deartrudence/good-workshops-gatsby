<p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday April 26, 2018</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> 6pm - 9pm</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Canada Learning Code Offices, 129 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5V 2L3, Fifth Floor</p>
<p>This Shopify app development workshop is targeted at developers who are looking to jump into app development for ecommerce projects. The workshop will introduce you to a variety of resources you can use to support your development with Shopify.</p>
<p>Using Ruby on Rails as a backend framework you will start building a base Shopify Private Application to integrate with one of your own development stores. You'll leave with a set of steps you can follow to start up any new app development project and a greater understanding of how clients' or your own shops could be served by a private app.</p>
